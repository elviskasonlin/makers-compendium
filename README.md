# The Makers' Compendium

> All hail the Omnissiah! He is the God in the Machine, the Source of All Knowledge. â€” Magos-Lector Vad Kapellax

The great big tome of resources collated by SP Makers' Club and its alumni.
Feel free to use the Wiki. Discussions are also enabled for collaboration.

The site is currently live over at [https://elviskasonlin.github.io/makers-compendium/](https://elviskasonlin.github.io/makers-compendium/). I might consider moving it onto a shorter domain and not rely on my personal github.io links.

Note: The material suppliers' list is periodically updated based on the internal google sheets

Installation

In order to run this on a local server, first install ruby. You may use your package manager or any ruby version manager utility. Afterwards, install bundler for gem management by typing the command below in your terminal.

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Once bundler has been successfully installed, execute the next command to install all the required dependencies (gems)

```
bundle install
```

To run the server locally, type the following command.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

Once the server is running, go to localhost:4000 and check it out.
